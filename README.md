# FREE:Enhanced Feature Representation for Isotopic Envelope Evaluation in Top-Down Mass Spectra Deconvolution
{Motivation:}The aim of deconvolution of top-down mass spectra is to recognize  monoisotopic peaks from the experimental envelopes in raw mass spectra. So accurate assessment of similarity between theoretical and experimental envelopes is a critical step in mass spectra data deconvolution. Existing evaluation methods primarily rely on intensity differences and m/z similarity, potentially lacking a comprehensive assessment. To overcome this constraint and facilitate a comprehensive and refined assessment of the similarity between theoretical and experimental envelopes, there exists an imperative to systematically explore and identify increasingly efficacious features for assessing this correspondence.
{Results:}  We present FREE(enhanced Feature Representation for isotopic Envelope Evaluation) that proficiently derives diverse feature representations, encapsulating fundamental physical attributes of envelopes, including peak intensity and envelope shape. We trained FREE and evaluated its performance on both the OT(human ovarian tumor cells) data set and the ZF(brain in mature female zebrafis) data set. Specifically, comparing the state-of-art methodï¼ŒFREE achieved higher accuracy and ROCAUC scores on both the OT and ZF data sets, and it demonstrated accurate predictions of a greater number of positive envelopes among the top-ranked envelopes based on their scores. Moreover, within a specific dataset to ZF, the amalgamation of FREE with TopFD exhibits a commendable capacity to discern 117,883 fragment ions, thus surpassing the 97,554 fragment ions identified through the application of EnvCNN in conjunction with TopFD. Notably, among these fragment ions, those that achieve validation through the identification of PrSMs(peptide-spectrum matches) by TopPIC result in a significant improvement of up to 21%.
